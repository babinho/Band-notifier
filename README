Band notifier is a simple app used to manage gigs for music bands. 
You can track gigs by date, and even notify band members by e-mail if you wish

Installation:

git clone git://github.com/babinho/Band-notifier.git
cd Band-notifier
bundle install
rails s


That should be it, if someone wants to add something else to the readme, fork and make a pull request.

This application is a rewrite of a similar application i wrote in asp.net mvc.
